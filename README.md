## InstaDApp Smart Accounts

During Feb. 25, 2020 to Mar. 3, 2020, we had the chance to perform security auditing on InstaDApp Smart Accounts.
With one person-week workload, we identified 1 high severity issues, 2 medium issues, and 7 minor issues.
The two medium issues which may affect business logic are properly resolved.
However, the high severity DoS issue is left as is since the attacker makes no benefit to front run the initialization process.
As per discussion with the team, the current design makes the system an open framework for users and developers.
To the best of our knowledge, the final patched code has no significant security issue.
